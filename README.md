# dmdSchemeRepository
This is a repository for dmdSchemes. The schemes are in the folder `schemes`. They are `.tar.gz` files which contains at lease one definition of the scheme as `.xml` file or `.xlsx` file.
The `.xlsx` file is preferred, as it contains formating of the spreadsheet which is kept when the scheme is used.
