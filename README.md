# dmdSchemeRepository
This is a repository for dmdSchemes. The schemes are in the folder `schemes`. 

They are `.tar.gz` files which contains **a folder named  `NAME_VERSION` 
and at lease one definition of the scheme of type `NAME_VERSION.xml` file or `NAME_VERSION.xlsx`.

A `NAME_VERSION.xlsx` file is preferred, as it contains formating of the spreadsheet which is kept when the scheme is used.
